        <h1>About Me.</h1>
            <p>Diligent, energetic Administration Clerk. Over eight 
            years of practical expertise as a personal assistant 
            and in front office tasks, such as account reconciliations 
            and invoicing. I have exceptional critical thinking skills 
            and am creative in solving problems. Able to take the 
            initiative to offer support and aid to others.</p>

            <p>I recently started honing my web development skills, 
            and I am now attending Angela Yu's 2024 Web Developer 
            Bootcamp. Having worked for more than 15 years, I have 
            developed people skills that have given me an advantage 
            as a developer and allowed me to handle challenging 
            situations and solve challenges.</p>
